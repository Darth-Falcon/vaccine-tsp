# Particle Swarm Optimization for Vaccine Distribution (Traveling Salesman Problem)

## Alan Kirkpatrick

This project was created for the BGSU 2021 Falcathon. The goal of the program is to solve the traveling salesman problem for vaccine distribution. Instead of a traditional TSP, this problem will instead look at how to vaccinate the most people as quickly as possible. This is done by looking at population density, risk factors, distance, and time as opposed to solely optimizing distance. The optimization algorithm used is PSO. Finally, in order to decrease the time needed the algorithm is parallelized using OpenMP.
